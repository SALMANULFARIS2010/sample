    <dd>Computer is an electronic device that is designed to work with Information.A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.
       Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. 
       The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or
        to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</dd>

  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags
   Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</dd>
